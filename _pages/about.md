I am an incoming associate professor at Georgetown University's <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu" target="_blank">McCourt School of Public Policy</a>. I also serve as a Fellow in the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov" target="_blank">Office of Evaluation Sciences</a> at the General Services Administration where I work with Agency partners to design and implement large-scale RCTs.

In my research, I study how government reforms affect public employees and the people they serve -- especially access to public services and programs. I also work with public organizations in the US and abroad to design and apply behavioral interventions to improve government effectiveness.

I received the <a href="http://pmranet.org/awards/" target="_blank">Beryl Radin Award</a> for the best article published in the *Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory (JPART)*. I am also co-editor of <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/experiments-in-public-management-research/8DB826A84D228568AAEC69732C72F1EC" target="_blank">*Experiments In Public Management Research: Challenges and Contributions*</a> (Cambridge University Press), and editor-in-chief of the <a href="http://www.journal-bpa.org" target="_blank">Journal of Behavioral Public Administration</a>, a not-for-profit, open-access journal.

Born in Germany, I received my master's in public administration from Zeppelin University (Germany), and PhD from Erasmus University Rotterdam (the Netherlands). Prior to joining Georgetown, I was an assistant professor in the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">School of Public Affairs and Administration</a> at Rutgers.
