I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">School of Public Affairs and Administration</a> at Rutgers University-Newark where I am also co-directing the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/cebpa" target="_blank">Center for Experimental and Behavioral Public Administration</a>.  I also serve as a Fellow in the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov" target="_blank">Office of Evaluation Sciences</a> at the General Services Administration.  In July 2020, I will be joining the <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu" target="_blank">McCourt School of Public Policy</a> at Georgetown University as an Associate Professor.

My research applies insights from the behavioral sciences to public management and policy to study how government reforms affect public employees and the people they serve â€“ especially with regard to social equity in access to public services and programs. I also work with public organizations in the US and abroad to design and apply behavioral interventions to improve government effectiveness across different domains.

I received the <a href="https://pmranet.org/awards/" target="_blank">Beryl Radin Award</a> for the best article published in the *Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory (JPART)*. I am also co-editor of <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/experiments-in-public-management-research/8DB826A84D228568AAEC69732C72F1EC" target="_blank">*Experiments In Public Management Research: Challenges and Contributions*</a> (Cambridge University Press), and founding editor of the <a href="http://www.journal-bpa.org" target="_blank">Journal of Behavioral Public Administration</a>, a not-for-profit, open-access journal.
